<h2>‚ö°FastAPI Doc</h2>

This API uses **FastAPI** to provide services for processing and indexing PDF documents, as well as managing transformer models. The API includes endpoints for querying documents, downloading models, indexing new PDFs, and resetting an Elasticsearch index. Protected with a token system, the API is secured and track user's requests. User's token are encrypted with Triple DES and stored in a Database.

### Prerequisites

- **Encryption Key** (Create a 24 bytes key) : ```python toolbox/generate_key.py```
- **Token Database** (Create a token database on first start) : ```python toolbox/token_manager.py```


To start the API server, run:
```bash
uvicorn fast_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload --port 8083

<h2>Ollama Models Benchmark Summary</h2>

#### **Time Performance**
| Model                  | Total Time (s) | Average Time per Query (s) | Number of Queries |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| **mistral:latest**     | 257.81         | 85.94                      | 3                  |
| **phi3:3.8b**          | 196.86         | 65.62                      | 3                  |
| **qwen2.5-coder:3b**   | 110.98         | 36.99                      | 3                  |
| **gemma2:latest**      | 323.61         | 107.87                     | 3                  |
| **llama3.2:latest**    | 101.65         | 33.88                      | 3                  |

- **Fastest Model:** `llama3.2:latest` with an average query time of **33.88s**.
- **Slowest Model:** `gemma2:latest` with an average query time of **107.87s**.

#### **Resource Consumption**
- **CPU Usage:**
  - Spikes observed up to 1600% utilization across 16 CPUs.
  - Sustained usage varied between 600% and 1200% during intensive query phases.
- **Memory Usage:**
  - Peaked at **27.02GB** out of 30.48GB.
  - Steady increments in memory consumption noted during benchmark progression.

#### **Linguistic Robustness**
- All five models can write almost perfectly in English. However, I've already seen some grammatical faults in other languages like French while using Llama3.2.
- Testing all languages trained on each models can perfect this benchmark, although using English for every prompt avoid spelling mistakes.

#### **Relevance of Responses**
- In my opinion `gemma2` provide detailed answers, constructed only with informations given from the documentation and not other informations.
- `mistral` and `llama3.2` are still well-trained models but they can provide fake informations by inventing them if they don't find answers.
- `phi3` and `qwen2.5` show good answers, but `phi3` seems to be more efficient than `qwen2.5` which provides short answers with a lack of details


### **System Specifications**

| Component          | Specification                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RAM**            | 64GB                                                          |
| **CPU**            | 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz (8 cores, 16 threads) |
| **Docker Allocations** | ~32GB RAM and 16 logical CPUs                               |
| **GPU**            | Not utilized (Ollama runs on CPU)                              |

### **Observations**
1. **Time Efficiency:** `llama3.2:latest` delivered the fastest responses, making it the most time-efficient model for the queries.
2. **Resource Usage:**
   - High CPU utilization was noted, suggesting intensive computation demands across all models.
   - Memory usage was near capacity, indicating the need for systems with significant memory resources for similar tasks.
3. **Performance vs. Time:** `gemma2:latest` was the slowest but consumed comparable CPU and memory resources to faster models like `qwen2.5-coder:3b`.

#### **Conclusion**
- For scenarios prioritizing speed, `llama3.2:latest` is the best option.
- For scenario prioritizing informations look-up in a document, `gemma2` seems to be the best option.

| phi3:3.8b        | The review identifies multiple environmental and biological risk factors associated with drug abuse and addiction. Environmental risks include aspects such as a chaotic home environment, exposure to substance use by parents or siblings, involvement in criminal behavior within the family, peer pressure from friends who use drugs, poor academic performance, lack of extracurricular activities, negative school experiences like harassment and bullying, unstable living conditions such as poverty, neighborhood violence, perceived community acceptance of drug-taking practices. Biological factors include genetics (estimated between 40 to 60 percent influence on a person‚Äôs vulnerability), gender disparities in substance abuse rates with males being more susceptible than females, and the prevalence of mental health disorders such as depression or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that can increase risk. Furthermore, personal characteristics like aggression, impulsivity, lack of self-control during childhood, poor social skills, academic competency issues also play a role in increasing addiction risks. | 61.49191761016846  |

| mistral:latest   |  Drugs alter the brain's reward system by flooding it with dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure. This overstimulation of the reward circuit produces euphoric effects that strongly reinforce the behavior of drug use, teaching the user to repeat it. Over time, long-term drug abuse can cause impairment in cognitive function and adaptations in habit or non-conscious memory systems. The brain learns to associate activities with pleasure or reward, making drugs more addictive than natural rewards due to their ability to release a greater amount of dopamine when taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 79.14704704284668  |
| phi3:3.8b        | Drugs of abuse alter the brain's reward system by flooding it with dopamine. Normally, dopamine is released in response to natural rewards like food and sex, which reinforces behaviors essential for survival. However, drugs can cause a much greater release or mimic this process more effectively, leading to an exaggerated increase in dopamine levels within the brain's reward circuitry. This disruption greatly amplifies messages related to pleasure and craving pathways, which over time teaches individuals to repeat drug-taking behaviors as a form of self-medication or escape from negative emotions associated with cravings.<br><br>Additionally, some drugs can cause long-term changes in the brain's chemistry by affecting other neurotransmitters like glutamate that are involved in learning and memory processes within this circuitry. These alterations not only reinforce drug use but also impair cognitive functions such as decision making and problem solving, which further perpetuates addictive behaviors without conscious thought or control from the user. | 62.54024696350098  |

These consequences can lead to intellectual development delays, behavioral problems in children, academic struggles, increased risk of unplanned pregnancies, violence, and infectious diseases among adolescents. Furthermore, long-term drug abuse can impair cognitive function due to changes in the brain's reward circuit and learning ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 83.15089654922485 |
| phi3:3.8b        | The review indicates that individuals suffering from long-term drug addiction often encounter multiple medical issues. These may include diseases affecting the lungs, heart, blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), brain functions such as strokes or seizures due to cerebrovascular disorders and epilepsy respectively, various types of cancer caused by substances like nicotine found in smoked drugs, HIV/AIDS transmission through needle sharing among intravenous drug users (Hepatitis B and C can also be transmitted this way), lung diseases including emphysema or chronic bronchitis that are exacerbated by tobacco smoke abuse. Additionally, mental disorders like depression may worsen due to the physiological changes induced in brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and its connections with the nucleus accumbens during substance misuse; these areas are part of what is called reward circuitry. Furthermore, drug abusers often have impaired cognitive functions due to altered concentrations of neurotransmitters like glutamate that play a crucial role in learning and memory processes within the brain. Drug-seeking behavior becomes difficult for some individuals because they struggle with habitual or nonconscious memories associated with drug use, which can be triggered by environmental cues - this is known as conditioning. Lastly, prenatal exposure to drugs has harmful consequences on infants and children's developmental outcomes leading potentially to premature birth, low birth weight, slower intellectual growth, behavior issues in adulthsoftheir life, educational struggles during childhood, increased risk for unplanned pregnancies among teenagers addicted to drugs, susceptibility to violence and infectious diseases. | 72.8249089717865  |

It is also likely that some drug- exposed children will need educational support in the classroom to help them overcome what may be subtle deficits in developmental functioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 39.32793068885803 |
